# Reading the docs

This little project was made using Vue JS v2 and Bootstrap. I did not use any video tutorial or course to make this. Just the documentation provided by both tools in their websites.

I know this ain't nothing. I am not special by doing this but i believe that every big project starts with a little step. And that's what I did here.
